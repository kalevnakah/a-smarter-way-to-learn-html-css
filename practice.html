<p class="color justy indenty offsety">This is how most people label themselves. But when you know "who" and
not what your identity is in, you very different answers. Especially when
the who is the one who created the earth and the universe. </p>

<p class="spacey">
I am <em>Job Title</em>. Approved worker of God.
</br>I am <i>Related To</i>. Adopted son of God.
